class MockEngine(object):
    """
    ``MockEngine`` represents the low-level mocking engine abstraction
    layer between ``pook`` and the underlying mocking mechanism
    responsible of intercepting and trigger outgoing HTTP traffic within
    the Python runtime.

    ``MockEngine`` implements the built-in `pook` mock engine based on HTTP
    interceptors strategy.

    Developers can implement and plug in their own ``MockEngine`` in order
    to fit custom mocking logic needs.

    You can see a custom ``MockEngine`` implementation here:
    http://bit.ly/2EymMro

    Custom mock engines must implementent at least the following methods:

    - `engine.__init__(self, engine)`
    - `engine.activate(self)`
    - `engine.disable(self)`

    Custom mock engines can optionally implement the following methods:

    - `engine.add_interceptors(self, *interceptors)`
    - `engine.flush_interceptors(self)`
    - `engine.disable_interceptor(self, name) -> bool`

    Arguments:
        engine (pook.Engine): injected pook engine to be used.

    Attributes:
        engine (pook.Engine): stores pook engine to be used.
        interceptors (list[pook.BaseInterceptor]): stores engine-level HTTP
            traffic interceptors.

        Adds one or multiple HTTP traffic interceptors to the current
